# Note on Music Files
This assignment was a chance for me to learn some more music theory and compose some tracks for my game. In total, I have managed to compose four tracks so far, three of which are currently being used for a level in the game. However, as the music files are rather large (approximately `40 MB` each), and taking in other factors such as copyright issues, I have made the decision to not post the music files here on Github.

If the program does not work due to the missing music files (It should still work, but just in case), delete all lines of code relating to them and it should work.
